## Bio

I am a Staff Data Scientist at Grubhub leading Online Experimentation & Causal Inference for Delivery Fulfillment.
My current interests are researching and productionizing both sequential testing and reinforcement learning
algorithms for online experimentation. Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Statistics
at Harvard University within the
[Statistical Reinforcement Learning Lab](http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~samurphy/lab/overview.html)
supervised by [Professor Susan Murphy](http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~samurphy/). Prior to that, I was
a postdoctoral researcher at University of Technology Sydney, supervised by
[Professor Matt Wand](https://matt-p-wand.net/).

## Research interests

Mobile health, reinforcement learning, sequential decision making,
streamlined computing for variational inference, bayesian hierarchical models.
